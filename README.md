# DabbeWala
The Dabbewala project connects hostel students with local tiffin services for seamless meal ordering. It empowers small tiffin providers, especially women entrepreneurs, by enhancing their reach and simplifying management. Dabbewala delivers healthy, affordable meals while supporting home-based businesses.
